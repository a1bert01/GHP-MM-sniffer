communication between the unit and the controller:
```
- modbus 9600 8n1 (B - brown A - red wire to the controller, or L_A L_B to U19 on the base board)
- master: unit; slave: controller (id: 240)
```
```
-unit regularly writes its operating data to the  at addr position 300+40 see manual - parameter reading ( M + down arrow buttons )
-the unit regularly writes temperatures and something (addr position 1000): GHP/10/240/1000: [0, 21, 44, 21, 0]
-the unit regularly reads the driver status (addr position 2000): GHP/3/240/2000: [8, 1, 16, 20, 26, 43, 27]:
8 - current operational mode 
1 - controller is on (0 - off)
16 - some bit mask 16 = 00001000 5th bit night mode enabled
20 - cooling temperature
43 - DHW temperature
27 - heating temperature
- the unit regularly queries the registers (operation 0x04, address 0)

    ID: 240, Read Input Registers: 0x04, Read address: 0, Read Quantity: 4
    ID: 240, Read Input Registers: 0x04, Read byte count: 8, Read data: [00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00]

- when service settings are changed, the 1st register is set to 1 and the unit reads the current setting several times in succession
- write requests for slaves 251 and 224 can be seen on bus too (with no response)

```
a sample communication,  "GHP/10/240/400" is my topic for MQTT message means operation 0x10,slave 240, address 400, followed by json array of short integers
